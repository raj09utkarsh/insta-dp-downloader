### To all the stalkers out there, this one is for you... :P

## Steps:
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies using `pip3 install requests bs4 Pillow`
2. Open terminal and change directory to the downloaded folder
3. Run python3 app.py and enter the username of the person of whom you want to download the image

## Issues:
Downloaded images are still not of best quality so it will be great if you can contribute in enhancing the images.
